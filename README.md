# mem-profiler
A lightweight project for RAM consumption profiling over the time.

This project intended for personal usage for now since the more notorious memory-profiler package is no longer maintained and issues will not be resolved.

If you have any ideas, remarques or you want to contribute, do not hesitate to ping me or to create a pull request or a ticket. I will gladly have a look at it.

The objective of this project is to provide a decorator capable of tracking RAM consumption of a function over the time and to plot and save the results into an image.
